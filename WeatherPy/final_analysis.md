Final Analysis

Part 1 
Weather API

- I could never get citipy working on my own.  I had to used the code block given.

- The starter file came with a cities.csv file with 500+ cities, which I cleaned, plotted and linear regression.

- Plotting and linear regression showed an expected outcome in max temperature. As scatter plots
moved closer to 0 degress latitude, temperatures increase, at a near 1 r rate.  No discrenable 
pattern could be seen or supported by the r value in cloudiness, wind speed or humidity.

- Northern Hemisphere Wind Speed was the most suprising r value of 0.76. Regardless of Latitude
measurement, wind speed was fairly consistant between 0 to 10 mph. 


Part II
Vacation API

- Here is completed attemped to correct my error from Part I creating a new work book using the
coitipy code block and creating a new dataframe.

- Cleaned and create a heat map using Latitude and Longitude with humidity was the heat weight.

- To look for an idea vacation spot, I chose cities that have a max temperature over 80 degress, 
less than 40% cloudiness and less than 50% humidity.

- With the above filters, 10 total cities fit these parameters. All appearing in South East Asia,
India and Austraila.  

- And it appears my ideal place to vacation is Austraila. 

- I was unable to get the Hotel Marker Labels to work.
